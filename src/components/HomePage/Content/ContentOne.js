            Llama, (Lama glama), South American member of the camel family, 
            Camelidae (order Artiodactyla), closely related to the alpaca, guanaco, and vicu√±a, 
            which are known collectively as lamoids. Unlike camels, lamoids do not have the characteristic camel humps; 
            they are slender-bodied animals and have long legs and necks, short tails, small heads, and large, pointed ears.
            Gregarious animals, they graze on grass and other plants. When annoyed, they spit. Lamoids are able to interbreed 
            and to produce fertile offspring.
