            Most herds of llamas are maintained by the Indians of Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Chile, and Argentina.
            Llama is the largest of the lamoids, it averages 120 cm (47 inches) at the shoulder. A 113-kilogram (250-pound) 
            llama can carry a load of 45–60 kg and average 25 to 30 km (15 to 20 miles) travel a day. The llama’s high thirst tolerance, 
            endurance, and ability to subsist on a wide variety of forage makes it an important transport animal on the bleak Andean plateaus 
            and mountains. The llama is a gentle animal, but, when overloaded or maltreated, it will lie down, hiss, spit and kick, and refuse 
            to move.
