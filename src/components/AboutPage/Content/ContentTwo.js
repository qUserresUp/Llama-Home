            Llama is very adorable, so I want to have my website to look warm and colorful. 
            I included many pictures and videos of llama to let people have a closer look at 
            these cute faces and learn more about their lifestyle.

            I build my website using React framework and Material UI library. 
            I have been following an online course and working with React in my spare time for the
            past four months. It is very exciting to apply my knowledge to build interesting web applications.
            It is my first time using Material UI library. I chose to learn about it because I want to create 
            better user interfaces for my application. There are many more things I want to add to my website, 
            such as animation and 3-D models. You are not seeing them because I am still learning these techniques!
