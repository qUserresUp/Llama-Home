            Front-end development is super fun! Building a website is not just about putting text and
            pictures together, there are a lot more to it. I love web applications because of their simplicity and accessibility.

            I think web applications will be the future trend. With only the internet and a browser, people are able to access powerful 
            applications anywhere. As cloud services become so powerful, many companies turn their software solutions to 'Software As A Service' business model; 
            Web games are emerging, people can play games without installation and hardware requirements; Online shopping plays a big role in peopleâ€™s everyday 
            life and many people are starting their own businesses online. All these services need to provide the clients a simple and smooth user interface, 
            and that is the job of front-end engineer.

            As I learn more about front-end development,  I find it to be more interesting. I want to build web applications with beauty and extreme user experience.
